# Simple JS Toc
by Timo van Neerden, 2016

---

This JS script creates a table-of-contents (TOC) based on the headings in the document. The TOC is based on HTML-lists (UL/LI).


## Usage

- Put a `<ul id="toc"></ul>` element anywhere in your page ;
- Put the JS code at the end of your document ;
- Enjoy.

No jQuery, no bullshit.

If the headings do contain links to refer to themeself, the TOC will have the links too.
